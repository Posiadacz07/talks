# Building AI in Browser - Deep Dive into Essential Frameworks

## Abstract
The landscape of web-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly evolving, with increasing demands for performant, client-side solutions. This session provides a practical overview of key open-source frameworks enabling hardware-accelerated web AI development.
We will explore the capabilities and use cases of TensorFlow.js for flexible model deployment and training in-browser with hardware acceleration; Transformers.js for efficient in-browser execution of transformer-based models for natural language processing; WebLLM for running LLMs locally in-browser with hardware acceleration; and the open, standardized WebNN API for efficient neural network computation on various hardware accelerators (GPUs, etc.) in web browsers.
For each framework, we will present a simple example application, highlighting its unique strengths and demonstrating how developers can leverage hardware acceleration to achieve real-time performance. This session equips web developers with the knowledge to select and utilize the appropriate open-source frameworks and standards for their AI-powered web applications.

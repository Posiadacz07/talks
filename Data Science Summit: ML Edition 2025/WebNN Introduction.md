# WebNN: Introduction to Browser-Based Machine Learning

## Abstracts
Modern web applications increasingly demand advanced computing capabilities, including the processing of machine learning models. The traditional approach of sending data to a server generates delays, compromises privacy, and limits offline availability. This presentation will address how to transfer the processing of machine learning models directly to the web browser, minimizing these issues. During the presentation, we will discuss the WebNN (Web Neural Network API) browser standard, which enables local execution of machine learning models. We will explain how it utilizes the GPU, as well as the CPU and NPU, to accelerate computations. The presentation aims to show how WebNN can change the future of web applications, making them smarter and more responsive. Discover the potential of WebNN and join the era of artificial intelligence in the browser!
